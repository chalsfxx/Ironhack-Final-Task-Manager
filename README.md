## Description

This is the final project done during the Front End Development bootcamp at Ironhack that consists of a web page that allows you to manage your tasks.

It is an application created with Vue.js that allows users to create an account, add tasks to complete, edit them, mark them as completed and finally delete them. Our web page is linked to a database, where we will be storing all the user data and tasks. In this case, to manage it we will use Supabase, which offers us a subset of Back End functionalities that allows us to manage it as a service.

The objective of this project is to put into practice the knowledge of Vue.js obtained during the course and also to be able to connect it to an external database and manage it.


## Used Technology:

* __Client:__ Vue.js & Vite
